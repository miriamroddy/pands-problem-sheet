Weekly Tasks
======
# ***HelloWorld***
### Task
    Commit and push a file to the problem sheet called helloworld.py
### Code Description
This is a simple Python script that uses the [print()](https://realpython.com/python-print/)function in Python to output the text "Hello, World!" to the console. Anything with a # symbol is a comment - it's not executed by the program but provides commentary to the code.

<p>Usage</p>

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the hello_world.py script is located.
3. Open a terminal window and run the following command: python hello_world.py
4. The message "Hello, world!" should be printed to the console.

As this was mostly just an exercise in getting the environment set up, I only had to refer to the [course notes](https://vlegalwaymayo.atu.ie/course/view.php?id=6208) and some information on [getting started with git](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).

 # ***Bank***
 
 ### Task
	Write a program called bank.py . The program should:

	1. Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent).
	2. Add the two amounts
	3. Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and 
	decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 
  
  ### Code Description

The user is prompted to input the first amount in cents; the int() function is used to convert the user's input from a string 
to an integer, so that it can be used in calculations. The user is then prompted to input the second amount in cents.
The two amounts are added together using the + operator, and the result is stored in the total_amount variable.
To convert the cents to euros, we divide by 100 and then use the modulo operator (%). The string to be printed starts with the text: "The total amount is €", followed by a set of empty curly brackets. These brackets work as placeholders where the values of the euros and cents variables will be inserted in the final string.

 ### Challenges and Research

Initially I had used floating points in my calculations e.g. 
```
amount1 = float(input("Enter the first amount in euros: "))
amount2 = float(input("Enter the second amount in euros: "))
```
[Further reading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floating-point-error-in-python/) made it clear that using floating-point numbers in financial calculations can lead to rounding errors and inaccuracies. It is generally recommended to use integer arithmetic when performing these calculations.

 The task asks that the answer should feature a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount. This was something that took some research but I got guidance from [this post on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39935857/how-can-i-print-a-euro-%E2%82%AC-symbol-in-python). 
 I discovered that there are several ways of representing a euro symbol in python. I could choose between direct input, the unicode glyph number, glyph name or Windows 1252 codepage. Direct input seemed to be the most straightforward so I went with this.

Initially I had used a print() statement using the .format() method:

``` 
[print('The total amount is €{}.{}'.format(euros, cents))]
``` 

A downside of using the [.format() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp) is that it can be a bit verbose, so I simplified it by using an [f-string](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/f-string-formatting-in-python).

  # ***Accounts***  
   ### Task
	Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number 
	with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs). Extra: Modify the program to deal with account 
	numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement; comment your assumptions).
	
### Code Description
Two implementations of this program are included, the first of which reads in a ten-digit account number and the second of which reads in an account number of any length.

**Ten-digit implementation:**
This code prompts the user to input their 10-digit account number and masks the first six digits while displaying the last four digits. If the user enters an account number that is not 10-digits long, the program will display an error message and prompt the user to enter their account number again until a valid input is received - we use a [while loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp) to do this. 

Inside the loop, we read in the account number and check if it has exactly 10 digits using the len() function. If does, we concatenate "XXXXXX" with the last 4 digits using string slicing. We exit the loop using the [break statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-break-statement/). If the account number does not have exactly 10 digits, we print an error message and if it does, we display the masked account number.

**Any-length implementation**
Here we also use a slice function to extract the last 4 digits of the account number. Even though SEPA accounts can't be no longer than 34 characters, this code can cope with larger numbers - we don't patricularly need to limit the input to 34 digits here. Python calculates the number of Xs required by subtracting four from the length of the account number. We concatenate the XString variable and the last_4_digits string to create a masked account number, which we print to the console.

### Challenges and Research
The second part of the task was purposefully vague, presumably so we would examine what assumptions we would use in the real world. We're in the EU so I am going to assume that the longest number we're going to be using is 34 digits, since [the limit for a SEPA account is 34 digits](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/what-is-iban-discrimination-and-what-can-i-do-about-it) - they are typically alphanumeric, which shouldn't be an issue since the input is treated as a string rather than an int or a float.


This was a good opportunity to get some practice at [string manipulation](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/string-manipulation-in-python). For both iterations of the task, I read up on using 
 slicing strings on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp) and on [reddit/r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/shrw4q/a_comprehensive_guide_to_slicing_in_python/). This was also a nice chance to learn about and to play around with the [len function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp). 

=
I came back to this task in later weeks to add a [while loop](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/while-loops-in-python-while-true-loop-statement-example/#:~:text=A%20while%20loop%20will%20always,while%20the%20condition%20remains%20True%20.) to the 10-digit iteration. I hadn't included this initially as we only encountered them in Week 4. Including the loop ensures that we prompt the user until they input 10 digits.


  # ***Collatz***
### Task
    Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values 
	of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even,
	divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.


### Code Description

We ask the user to input a positive integer, and then use a while loop to perform a sequence of calculations on the number until it is equal to 1. Each time the while loop iterates, the current value of the number is printed to the console, with a space character separating the numbers.
We used an if statement to check whether the number is odd or even, using the modulo operator to do this. If the number is even, we divide by 2. If the number is odd, we multiply it by 3 and it's then added to 1. Finally we print the sequence to the console, formatted so it's all in one line.

### Challenges and Research

The Collatz Conjecture is an [slightly head-melting](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png) unsolved problem in mathematics, which posits that if you repeatedly apply a simple set of rules to a positive integer, you will eventually reach the number 1. The first challenge here is to understand the problem before implementing it in code. After learning about some of the theory behind the conjecture from [the Veritasium channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg&t=1s&ab_channel=Veritasium), I then researched how a sequence of calculations could best be done in Python. [This article in medium](https://medium.com/the-art-of-python/the-collatz-sequence-in-python-eb7e1f1b4f9e) was useful as was [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-print-collatz-sequence/, which explained this particularly simply.

This was a good chance to get to grips with [if statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp) and [while Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp). We need the while loop to iterate through the sequence of numbers and the if statement to check whether the number is odd or even. Initially my code outputted the text across multiple lines. A bit of googling gave me some infomation about the [end parameter]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfact-50-python-end-parameter-in-print/), that I could use to tidy up the output, [having each result on a new line](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp).

  # ***Weekend***
### Task
    Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The program should be called weekday.py.
	You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is.

### Code Description
We start by importing the [datetime module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html), which allows us to manipulate date and time object data.
We use the module to get the day of the week for the system's current date and time. We call the [weekday() 
method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weekday-function-of-datetime-date-class-in-python/) of the today object, which returns an integer representing the day of the week, with Monday being a 0 and Sunday being a 6.
We then create a tuple called weekdays, with each string in the tuple representing a weekday - Monday is 0 and Friday is 4.
We use an if statement to check if the day of the week is less than 5. If the day of the week is less than 5, we know that it must be a weekday (because Monday's index is 0 and Thursday's is 4). We then output the relevant message to the console, depending on whether today is a weekday or not.

### Challenges and Research
This task initially seemed a lot trickier than it turned out to be, highlighting how useful it is to know what modules are available in Python. [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29384696/how-to-find-current-day-is-weekday-or-weekends-in-python) ultimately clued me in on the datetime module. I learned how to create a datetime object using the [.datetime.datetime() constructor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html). It was a nice introduction to using lists, but I changed it to [a tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), since the days of the week are unlikely to change. This won't really affect the functionality but it seemed to be the more appropriate choice.

  # ***SquareRoot***

    Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
	You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
	I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
	This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would 
	use one of the above methods).I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
	This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, 
	so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable.

### Code Description
We start the program by defining the sqrt function. This involves taking a user inputted argument, assumed to be a floating-point number. If the number is positive, it starts with an initial guess of half the input value.
The program then sets a level of error for the acceptable difference between the current and previous guesses - we are going with .0001. We use a while loop to iterate until the difference between the current and previous guesses 
is within the level of error we deem acceptable. We use the abs function to ensure that the difference between the two guesses is always a positive number.
We use the round function so that we don't get too many decimal places in the output. A while loop is used that keeps going until the user inputs a positive-floating point number. 
When this happens, the loop terminates using the break statement. We can then use the sqrt function, call it on the user input (num) and print the result.

### Challenges and Research
This involved researching the [Newton-Raphson method](https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-your-own-newton-raphson-algorithm-in-python-a20a5b68c7dd), not something for the mathematically uninclined. It is an iterative method for finding the root of a function. It works by making an initial guess of the root, and then iteratively refining that guess by using the slope of the function at that point to estimate where the root might be. Or, in [layman's terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mh83qk/eli5_why_does_the_newtonraphson_method_work/), it's a way of finding the root by making an educated guess, and then making better and better guesses until we get the right answer. In Python, this can be implemented using a loop that updates the guess at each iteration until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. 

There are different strategies for choosing the initial guess, but I chose to go with n/2. It is a sensible starting point for many numbers because the square root of a number is always going to be less than or equal to half of the number itself, and seemed like the most straightforward approach. A [tolerance level](https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-your-own-newton-raphson-algorithm-in-python-a20a5b68c7dd) of .0001 was selected because it is generally considered to be a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Since the Newton-Raphson method is not defined for negative input numbers, I incorporated a method for handling negative input; a while loop did the job here.

I preffered an output that rounded the reult to two decimal places so this needed a bit of research - I used the [round function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_round.asp) which is nice and straightforward.

  # ***NumberofEs***
  
    Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. Think about what is being asked here,
	document any assumptions you are making.The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line

### Code Description
The first thing we do is import the sys module. The code uses [sys.argv](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-sys-argv-in-python/) to read the user-provided argument and pass it to the program. We know we need two arguments (the name of the program and the filename), so we use an if statement here. If the number of arguments is less than two, the program prints a message to the console advising how to format the query correctly, and exits.   
We use sys.argv[1] to retrieve the second element of the sys.argv list, assumed to be the filename input by the user. We use the open function (with mode r for reading) to read the contents of the file. 

Once the file is opened, the program iterates over each line of the file using a for loop. For every line, the code counts how many times the characters 'e' and 'E' appear 
in the line using the [count() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_count.asp) of the string object. It then adds the count of each line to a running total count. When the loop finishes, what is stored in count is the total
number of occurances of both 'e' and 'E' in the file. We use an f-string to print the number of occurances to the console.

### Challenges and Research

A challenge here was to find a method of taking the filename from an argument on the command line. [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-sys-argv-in-python/) was helpful here and I found that I could import the [sys module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html). I also found that we need to use a [with statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87DuQWjID_E) to ensure that the file is properly closed after Python is finished with it - this is an important step in avoiding errors.

 Some key assumptions here are that we are reading English language texts, and are not considering any other variations of the letter 'e', such as accented characters. If we were do so, we could import the [unicodedata](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html) module. Therfore we are just are interested in counting lowercase 'e' and uppercase 'E'.

  # ***PlotTask***
    
    Write a program called plottask.py that displays:

	a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
	and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10], 
	on the one set of axes. Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice (legend etc).

### Code Description

We begin by importing the [numpy library](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy/) and giving it the alias np [(for ease of reference)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/eeqmlh/why_bother_with_import_numpy_as_np/) and doing the same with the [matplotlib library](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_pyplot.asp), giving it the alias plt. 
We then generate 1000 random values from a normal distribution with mean of 5 and SD of 2. The generated values are stored in the data variable. When making the histogram, we have various arguments that we can play around with - e.g. we can select the transparancy of the histogram bars, we can create a nice legend etc.
We need to create a second array, called x, that contains a hundred evenly spaced values between 0 and 10 using the [numpy.linspace()](https://realpython.com/np-linspace-numpy/) method.  We calculate the function h(x) = x^3 for each value of x. We create labels for both axes and choose a title for the histogram. We then include a legend with the [legend() argument](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html). Finally, we show the resulting graph.

![Histogram](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-problem-sheet/blob/main/histogram.jpg?raw=true)

### Challenges and Research
Understand the problem requirement was challenging in itself, as was getting comfortable with using both libraries. Combining the histogram and function plot onto the same set of axes requires knowledge of how to create [multiple plots](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/ch04.html) on the same set of axes, and how to adjust the appearance of each plot (e.g. color, line style). The learning curve here was steep since the syntax is so different from standard Python. Understanding the various parameters that can be customized also took time, as did my attempts to make the plots look visually appealing.
