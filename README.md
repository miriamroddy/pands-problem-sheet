# Pands Problem Sheet 2023


In order that this be applicable to a real-world setting, comments within each program will explain the code used and to outline my thought processes, assumptions etc. so that the code is understandable. The purpose of variables, function etc. will be explained.

The commentary within the README is more focused on explaining each program in a more holistic manner. In a real-world setting, this is to help a user learn more about a project as a whole.

Weekly tasks
======
# ***HelloWorld***

    Commit and push a file to the problem sheet called helloworld.py

This is a simple Python script that uses the print() function in Python to output text to the console, so when we run this program, it will output the text "Hello, World!" to the console. Anything with a # symbol is a comment - it's not executed by the program but provides commentary to the code.

<p>*Usage*</p>
		1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
		2. Navigate to the directory where the hello_world.py script is located. 
		3. Open a terminal window and run the following command: python hello_world.py
		4. The message "Hello, world!" should be printed to the console.

  # ***Bank***

    Write a program called bank.py . The program should:

		*Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent).
		*Add the two amounts
		*Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between 
		the euro and cent of the amount 
	
  
  
   Commentary about specific code used is provided within the program. The task asks that the answer should be printed in a      human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount. This was something that took a bit of research but was ultimately answered by a post on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39935857/how-can-i-print-a-euro-%E2%82%AC-symbol-in-python. I could choose between direct input, the unicode glyph number, glyph name or Windows-1252 codepage. Direct input seems the most straightforward for someone new to coding so I went with this.

  # ***Accounts***  
   
	Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number 
	with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

----

  # ***Collatz***

    Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values 
	of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even,
	divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.


----

  # ***Weekend***

    Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The program should be called weekday.py.
	You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is.

  # ***SquareRoot***

    Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
	You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
	I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
	This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would 
	use one of the above methods).I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
	This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, 
	so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable.
