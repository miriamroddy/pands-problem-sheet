  # ***Bank***

    Write a program called bank.py . The program should:

		the euro and cent of the amount

  # ***Accounts***  
   
	Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number 
	with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

----

  # ***Collatz***

    Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values 
	of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even,
	divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.


----

  # ***Weekend***

    Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The program should be called weekday.py.
	You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is.

  # ***SquareRoot***

    Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
	You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
	I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
	This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would 
	use one of the above methods).I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
	This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, 
	so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable.
